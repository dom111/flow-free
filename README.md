# flow-free

A TS/SCSS exercise to recreate the game Flow Free with minimal components.

If you're not familiar with the game, you need to connect the two dots of the
same colour and ensure the entire board is filled with the flows. You also need
to get a perfect game by completing each flow first time.

This version currently doesn't display any information and only has three levels
preloaded that are selected randomly on load.
