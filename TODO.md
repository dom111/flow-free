- [x] Fix bug where pathfinding to a `Point` clears the `Path`.
- [ ] Only preview breaking paths until `Path.status() === Status.FINAL`.
- [ ] Track scoring and when complete.
- [ ] Level generator.
- [ ] Level solver (to help with the generator...)
- [ ] Allow solution to be included in URL hash fragment.
- [ ] Make a designer (need the solver to prove its doable too)
