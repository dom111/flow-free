- [x] Fix bug where pathfinding to a `Point` clears the `Path`.
- [ ] Only preview breaking paths, until `Path.status() === Status.FINAL`.
- [ ] Track scoring and when complete.
- [ ] Level generator.
- [ ] Level solver (to help with the generator...)
- [ ] Allow solutions to be included in level data - `Path`s.
- [ ] Make a designer (need the solver to prove its doable too)
- [ ] Add data definition for surrounding walls (allows `Warp`s)
- [ ] Add `walls` attribute to `Cell`. Probably another later, not within level data...
- [ ] Add `Hex` grid.
